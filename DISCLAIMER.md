## Data Accuracy

Park data displayed in this app (fees, hours, descriptions, coordinates) is
fetched from the [NPS public API](https://developer.nps.gov/) and refreshed
periodically. However:

- Information may be **out of date** between refresh cycles.
- Entrance fees, operating hours, and seasonal closures **change frequently**.
- Visitor center locations are approximate and may not reflect recent changes.

**Always verify current conditions directly with the park before your visit:**

- **NPS website:** [nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov)
- **Park alerts & closures:** [nps.gov/planyourvisit/conditions.htm](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/conditions.htm)
